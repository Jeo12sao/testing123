//Create and open a file in VS code and provide answers for the following questions//.
//This is open book. I want you to go look it up if you don’t know.
//Once you’ve completed it, push it up to a private repo on GitHub.

//1.What is an IP Address? 
//  Your IP address is your unique internet address similar to your home address. It tells websites, online
//  services and other devices where to find you.  IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of
//   rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network. The internet needs a way to 
//  differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites
 
//2. What is the IP address to your computer?
//  192.168.14.29

// 3. What is another name for the IP address of your computer?
// Identifier,IPv4, IPv6,Public and Private IP Address,Local Host IP,Static and Dynamic IP, 
// Broadcast and Multicast IP,Default Gateway IP

//4. What is a Port?
//   A computer port is a connection point or interface between a computer and an external or internal device.
//   Internal ports may connect such devices as hard drives and CD ROM or DVD drives; external
//   ports may connect modems, printers, mice and other devices.

//  5.  What is a Domain Name and what’s happening when you make a request to it via your browser?
//    A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. 
//      A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet
//    
//    Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this,
//    domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.
//    request:
//     You enter a URL into a web browser
//     The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS
//     The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
//     The server sends back a HTTP response
//     The browser begins rendering the HTML
//     The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-5.
//     Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further async requests as needed.

//6. What is a Server?
//A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
//  In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. 
//There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.

// 7.Is a Server a part of the Backend or Frontend of the web?
// Backend

//8. What is a Client?
//  A client is the receiving end of a service or the requestor of a service in a client/server model type of system.
//  The client is most often located on another system or computer, which can be accessed via a network

//9.Is a Client a part of the Backend or Frontend of the web?
//  Frontend 
//  Provide an example of a client.
//   Chrome, Safari and Duck Duck GO

//10. A Server-Side programming language is something that can do what?
//server-side website programming mostly involves choosing which content is returned to the browser in response to requests.
// The server-side code handles tasks like validating submitted data and requests, 
// using databases to store and retrieve data and sending the correct data to the client as required

//11.What are the primary languages to develop for the web / Client-Side?
//HTML,CSS,JAVA,JAVASCRIPT,Python, SQL, PHP, NET, C, C++,Go
//client side  JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

//12. What does Node allow us to do with one of the Client-Side languages?
//Node is an engine that runs JavaScript on a server. The creators of Node took the JavaScript engine from 
//browsers and added functionality so you can create backend applications using the JavaScript language.

 
//13. What is one way to retrieve and use others code in my project?
// API

//14 Where can I find these different pieces of code?
//ELEMENTS/npm

//15. What are these pieces of code called?
//modules/packages


//16.How can I create my own piece of code for use in my project or others?
//React-Router

//17.How do I add that piece of code in a specific file I want to use it in?
//React-Router

//18. Where can I find all of the pieces of code I’ve added from others into my project?
//console/elements

//19.What is an HTTP request?
//HTTP requests work as the intermediary transportation method between a client/application and a server. 
//The client submits an HTTP request to the server, and after internalizing the message, the server sends back a response. 
//The response contains status information about the request.

//20. What are the various HTTP status codes and what do each of them relate to?
//Informational responses (100–199)
//Successful responses (200–299)
//Redirection messages (300–399)
//Client error responses (400–499)
//Server error responses (500–599)

//21.What is Routing?
//Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination. These Internet routing
// decisions are made by specialized pieces of network hardware called routers.

//22.What is an API?
//Application Programming Interface) API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, 
//or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

//23. What is an API Key?
//An application programming interface key (API key) is a unique piece of code that's sent from one application to another on a network. This is an essential part of digital security.
// It prevents unauthorized programs from accessing a given function.

//What is JSON?
//JSON stands for J ava S cript O bject N otation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
// JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

//.25 What is the DOM?
//DOM is an acronym that stands for Document Object Model. It's how a web browser represents a web page internally. 
//The DOM determines what content should be on a page and how each element of the content relates to the other elements.
//  The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming 
// languages can connect to the page.
// The DOM is the primary way that your JavaScript code will interact with a web page. Specifically, the browser provides a document 
// variable that has properties and methods you can use to make changes to the page.
//The  (DOM) is a set of utilities for manipulating XML documents (and, by extension, also HTML documents, which is what we are most likely interested in).
//Before being able to make use of these utilities and helpers, DOM transforms XML files into a tree structure, that is,
// a hierarchy of nodes. This tree represents both the content of the document and the relationship between the nodes.

//.26 What is the BOM?
//The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to talk to the browser 
//about matters other than the content of the page.
 

//27.What can we use in order to respond to some interaction on a web page?
//div class,Buttons,greetings,etc

//28. Referring to the previous question, what are some specific things we can respond to?
//     greetings,password, name, etc

//29.Where can I go to see a web pages’ requests and their statuses?
//   network
//30.What can I use in code to ensure a website looks good on both a desktop browser and mobile browser?
//   performance/console
//31.What can I use in a browser to ensure a website looks good on mobile and desktop?
//   console/performance
//32.  What type of CSS selector can I use to target a single element?
//URLs with an # followed by an anchor name link to a certain element within a document. 
//The element being linked to is the target element.

//33.What type of CSS selector can I use to target multiple elements?
//If you want to style all the headers in that class, you have to do it like this (which could also be done without the line breaks). 
//Notice each selector has .live_grid in it:

//.live_grid h1,
//.live_grid h2,
//.live_grid h3,
//.live_grid h4,
//.live_grid h5,
//.live_grid h6 {
    /* style here */
//}
//34.Describe the parent element and a child element.
//ML Tree Structure. XML documents are formed as element trees. An XML tree starts at a root element and branches from the root to child elements. The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships between elements. Parents have children. Children have parents. 
//Siblings are children on the same level (brothers and sisters).

//35. What does the return keyword do in JavaScript?
//The return keyword explained. Let's explore what the return keyword in JavaScript does. The return keyword in 
//JavaScript is a keyword to build a statement that ends JavaScript code execution

//36.What’s the difference between let and const?
//The JavaScript let and const keywords provide block-level scope, but there is a slight difference in how they behave. 
//With const, you can not re-assign a value to the variable. With let,
//you can.

//37.What are Promises in detail?
//provides alternative to using callback for writing asynchronous code
//represents a value that will eventually arrive
//is an object with a .then() method and a .catch() method
//and it has a status property with one of the following values:
//pending
//fulfilled
//rejected

//38.Why do we need Promises?
//Use Promises to write cleaner, more readable asynchronous code.
//Use the browser's built-in fetch() function to retrieve data from a remote API.
//Build your asynchronous code as pipelines of pure functions, a.k.a. Promise chains.
//Wrap synchronous APIs in Promises to use in Promise chains.
//Coordinate multiple, interdependent Promise chains.
//Handle exceptions thrown inside of your functions.
//Use Promise.all() to wait for multiple Promises to finish.

//39.What are two ways we can choose a set of code to run based on some condition.
//We can use If and Esleif, 

//40.What’s one thing I can use to help me debug my code?
//Console will help because the error is listed
